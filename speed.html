<p>I am in the fortunate position that my dad has a true <br>
	fibre to the premise internet connection. Which currently <br>
	is a 330Mbps Download and 50Mbps Upload. Whilst this is <br>
	the exception rather than the rule, here in the UK it has <br>
	remained stable at the quoted supply speeds for the last 4 years.<br>
	This is more than sufficent speed to run this website currently,<br>
	and also allows me to use my Playstation 4, and allow my dad <br>
	his computer, and the Sky Q box. Eventually more of the UK <br>
	will have speeds in excess of 100Mbps, which will be a great <br>
	game changer for the people that recieve these speeds.
